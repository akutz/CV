==============

Software Engineer

Qualities such as drive, focus, and ambition may propel ideas from paper to production, but success is sustained through collaboration. My goal is to be the kind of team member that demonstrates the best tool for teaching is listening to others. I am interested in a staff engineering or fellow role involving cloud native technologies, scalable and distributed design, and community engagement.

Areas of expertise include `Golang`_, Cloud computing, `Kubernetes`_, continuous integration and delivery, and software integration.
